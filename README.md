Pitch: The Very Hungry Caterpillar but Genetically Modified for world domination.
You start out as a normal-sized caterpillar inside a lab. However, you have an irresistible
urge to consume. I want the game to have 5 stages/levels, with each becoming more dramatic
than the last. Between each stage there would be a cutscene of a lab report that describes
the state of the caterpillar.
